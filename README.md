### Welcome to the router thingy!
It does stuff!

### Instructions for use:
## There are two main routes:
The jplRoute calls directly from the jsonplaceholder.typecode.com data set

## Each route has a specific function
For instance, if you woud like to view all of the user posts, tpe in the following into a URL bar:

## /allPosts
This retieves all of the posts made by users in beautiful json

If you would like to get all of the posts made by a specific user, type:

## /allPosts/<username>
This retrieves all the posts made by the user

Next, perhaps you would like to see a specific post you happen to know the id for...
Simple! Type:

## /posts/<id>
And that will return the posts for which you are looking

Finally, for the jplRoute, if you would like to see the profile of a user, type:

## /profile/<username>
And that will bring up their informaion
